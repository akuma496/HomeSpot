2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
These describe how the system performs its functions.

NFR 1.0 - Performance
NFR 1.1 - Response Time: The system SHALL respond to user actions (e.g., loading tasks, adding expenses) within 2 seconds under normal load.

NFR 1.2 - Concurrent Users: The system SHALL support at least 500 concurrent active users for the MVP, with the ability to scale to tens of thousands of concurrent users.

NFR 1.3 - Data Load Time: Task lists and expense summaries SHALL load within 3 seconds for groups with up to 100 tasks/expenses.

NFR 1.4 - Cost Efficiency: The system architecture SHALL be designed to be cheap and maintainable in the long run, minimizing operational costs even at scale.

NFR 1.5 - AI/ML Integration (Deferred): The system's incorporation of AI, specifically for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to process receipts and feed to AI for payment/split breakdown assistance, is deferred from the MVP.

NFR 2.0 - Scalability
NFR 2.1 - User Base Growth: The architecture SHALL be designed to scale efficiently to accommodate a rapidly growing user base (e.g., from 500 to 100,000+ users).

NFR 2.2 - Data Volume Growth: The database SHALL be able to handle a continuously increasing volume of tasks, messages, and expense data without significant performance degradation.

NFR 2.3 - Feature Expansion: The system architecture SHALL be modular and extensible to allow for the easy addition of new features without requiring a complete rewrite.

NFR 3.0 - Security
NFR 3.1 - Data Encryption: All sensitive user data and communications (e.g., login credentials, financial data) SHALL be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

FR 3.2 - Access Control: The system SHALL enforce robust access control, ensuring users can only access data relevant to their households/groups and personal tasks/expenses.

NFR 3.3 - Authentication: The system SHALL use industry-standard authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, Firebase Authentication).

NFR 3.4 - Compliance: No specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) are anticipated for the MVP, but the architecture should allow for future compliance as needed.

NFR 3.5 - Account Recovery: Basic security practices SHALL be implemented for account recovery (e.g., forgotten password).

NFR 4.0 - Reliability & Availability
NFR 4.1 - Uptime: The system SHALL maintain an uptime of 99.9% (excluding scheduled maintenance).

NFR 4.2 - Data Backup: All data SHALL be regularly backed up to prevent loss.

NFR 4.3 - Error Handling: The system SHALL gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.

NFR 5.0 - Usability
NFR 5.1 - Intuitive UI: The user interface SHALL be intuitive and easy to navigate for users of all technical skill levels.

NFR 5.2 - Cross-Platform Compatibility: The app SHALL be accessible and functional across various devices and operating systems.

Explanation: Cross-platform compatibility means that your app works correctly on different types of devices and operating systems without needing separate development efforts for each. For example, a single codebase could potentially run on:

Mobile: iOS (Apple iPhones/iPads) and Android phones/tablets.

Web: Accessible through any standard web browser on desktops, laptops, or mobile devices.

The priority indicates where you want the primary development focus or initial release to be (e.g., "mobile first," or "web first").

NFR 5.3 - Real-time Updates: Changes made by one user (e.g., task completion, message sent, task detail modification) SHALL be reflected in real-time for other relevant users.

NFR 6.0 - Maintainability
NFR 6.1 - Code Quality: The codebase SHALL adhere to high coding standards, be well-documented, and be easy to understand and modify.

NFR 6.2 - Monitoring: The system SHALL have comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities to quickly identify and diagnose issues.

Explanation: Logging and monitoring are essential for understanding how your application is performing and for quickly troubleshooting problems. Critical metrics typically include:

Error Rates: How often errors occur (e.g., server errors, database connection failures, unexpected user input errors). High error rates indicate instability.

API Response Times (Latency): How long it takes for your application's server to respond to requests. Slow response times impact user experience (NFR 1.1).

User Activity Metrics: Number of active users, common feature usage, successful logins, etc. This helps understand engagement and identify performance bottlenecks related to high traffic.

Resource Utilization: CPU, memory, and disk usage of your servers and database. This helps ensure your infrastructure can handle the load and scale effectively.

Database Query Performance: How long database queries take, identifying slow queries that might need optimization.

System Uptime/Availability: Confirming that the application is running and accessible (NFR 4.1).

NFR 6.2.1 - Monitoring Tools: The system SHALL integrate Firebase Crashlytics for crash reporting and Google Cloud Logging for general application logging and monitoring.

3. Database Persistence Considerations
The choice for the database for HomeHub's MVP and initial scale is Firestore.

Given HomeHub's strong emphasis on real-time updates for tasks and messaging, scalability for a growing user base, and the benefits of a managed service to reduce operational burden, Firestore is the recommended candidate. Its flexible schema also aligns well with potential future feature expansions. While PostgreSQL offers robust data integrity for financial aspects, the real-time and scaling advantages of Firestore for the core collaborative features outweigh the complexity of managing real-time capabilities with PostgreSQL for this application.

Firestore Data Management: For messages and expenses, the implementation SHALL ensure pagination to efficiently load and display large volumes of data without impacting performance.

4. MVP Prioritization
Based on your updated guidance, here's the refined MVP scope for HomeHub:

MVP Keep (Essential Features):

User Management: Households, inviting users, friends list management (FR 1.0).

Task Management Core: Task creation, assignment, scheduling (basic recurrence is included), and task reminders (in-app and push notifications) (FR 2.1, FR 2.2, FR 2.3, FR 2.7, FR 2.8).

Task Conversation: Text-only chat within tasks (FR 2.10.1, FR 2.10.3).

Expense Management Core: Logging expenses with equal splitting, and automatic balance calculation (FR 3.1, FR 3.2 (simplified), FR 3.3).

General Group Messaging: Basic, text-only chat for households (FR 4.1.1).

Push Notifications: For tasks and messages (FR 2.7.2, FR 4.1.4).

Shopping List Management: Including creation, item management, and repeat items with visual indicators and specific adding gestures (FR 5.0).

MVP Simplify (Reduced Scope for Initial Release):

Calendar Integration: MVP will be one-way export (ICS) only. Two-way sync and conflict resolution are deferred (FR 2.9).

Expense Splitting: MVP will support equal splits only. Unequal splitting options (percentage, direct share) are deferred (FR 3.2).
